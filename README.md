Selenium Design Patterns Project

This project is designed to showcase the application of design patterns in test automation, with a focus on enhancing the scalability, maintainability, and readability of automated tests. By implementing proven design patterns, the test framework can handle complex test cases more efficiently and ensure long-term flexibility.

Key Features

	•	Design Patterns: Utilizes well-established patterns such as Page Object, Factory, Strategy, Proxy, Execute Around, Command, and Template Design to improve code structure.
	•	Docker Integration: Easily run the tests in isolated environments using Docker for consistent and reproducible test execution.
	•	Jenkins Integration: Automated test execution and continuous integration using Jenkins, ensuring that tests run automatically with each code change and build.
	•	Java 8: Written using Java 8 for robust backend support, ensuring compatibility with modern systems.

Technologies Used

	•	Selenium: Web automation for testing.
	•	Java 8: Core language for implementing the test framework.
	•	Docker: Containerization for consistent test execution across environments.
	•	Jenkins: Continuous integration and automated test execution.

 Design Patterns Implemented

	•	Page Object Pattern: Abstracts UI elements into reusable objects.
	•	Factory Pattern: Helps manage object creation for different test scenarios.
	•	Strategy Pattern: Allows selecting algorithms or behaviors at runtime.
	•	Proxy Pattern: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.
	•	Execute Around Pattern: Ensures proper resource management with predefined actions.
	•	Command Pattern: Encapsulates requests as objects, allowing for parameterization.
	•	Template Design Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.
